# -Content-Based-Movie-Recommender-System

A machine learning project that recommends movies to users based on content similarity (such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and descriptions). Unlike collaborative filtering, this system doesn’t rely on user ratings—it learns from the features of the movies themselves to suggest similar films.
Key Features:
Dataset Handling – Works with datasets like TMDB/IMDB.
Data Preprocessing – Cleans and processes metadata (genres, cast, crew, overview, keywords).
Similarity Matching – Calculates cosine similarity between movie vectors.
Movie Recommendations – Suggests top-N similar movies for any input movie.
