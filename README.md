# -Content-Based-Movie-Recommender-System

A machine learning project that recommends movies to users based on content similarity (such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and descriptions). Unlike collaborative filtering, this system doesn’t rely on user ratings—it learns from the features of the movies themselves to suggest similar films.
